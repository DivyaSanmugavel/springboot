## **Project Goal:**

Build a web application where users can search, view, and book hotels. The system shows hotels “nearby” based on the user’s chosen or detected location. The data is managed in your own database (with sample/fake hotel details).

---

## **Core Features & Steps**

### **1. Database & Backend Setup**

- **Design your MySQL database:** Create tables for hotels (with name, address, latitude, longitude, etc.), users, bookings, etc.
- **Add sample hotels:** Manually populate your hotels table with several hotels, each having a city/address and their latitude/longitude.

### **2. Backend API with Spring Boot**

- **Create REST APIs:**
    - **Hotels API:** Get all hotels, get hotel by ID, search hotels by location (latitude/longitude), etc.
    - **Bookings API:** Book a room, view bookings, etc.
- **Nearby Search Logic:**
    - Accept user’s location (latitude/longitude) and return hotels within a certain distance using the Haversine formula in SQL or Java.

### **3. Frontend Setup (React + HTML/CSS/JS)**

- **User Interface:** Build pages for hotel listings, hotel details, booking form, user login/register.
- **Location Input:**
    - **Option 1:** Use browser geolocation to get the user’s real coordinates.
    - **Option 2:** Let user type/select a city/area, and use predefined coordinates for search.

### **4. Connecting Frontend and Backend**

- **API Calls:** Use fetch or Axios in React to call your Spring Boot backend.
- **Display Results:** Show the list of hotels returned by the backend to the user, sorted by distance or relevance.

### **5. Booking Functionality**

- Allow users to select a hotel and book a room for specific dates.
- Store booking data in the database and show users their booking history.

### **6. (Optional) Extra Features**

- User authentication (login/register).
- Pagination for long hotel lists.
- Admin panel to add/edit/delete hotels.
- Reviews and ratings for hotels.
- Email notifications for bookings.

## **How “Nearby Hotels” Works**

1. You add hotels with their latitude/longitude to your database.
2. When a user searches “nearby hotels,” your frontend sends their location to the backend.
3. The backend calculates the distance to each hotel (using math) and returns the closest ones.
4. Frontend displays these hotels as “nearby.”

---

## **Typical User Flow**

1. User opens your website/app.
2. User allows location access or enters a city/area.
3. App shows a list of hotels nearby (from your database).
4. User views hotel details and books a stay.
5. Booking confirmed, stored in the system.

## **Summary Table**

|Step|What You Do|
|---|---|
|Design database|Model hotels with name, address, latitude, longitude, etc.|
|Add sample data|Populate hotels table with fake/sample hotels and real coordinates.|
|Build backend|Create Spring Boot REST APIs for hotels, bookings, and search.|
|Implement nearby logic|Use Haversine formula to find hotels near a given location.|
|Build frontend|Use React to build hotel listing, details, booking, and search UI.|
|Connect everything|Fetch hotels from backend and display on frontend; book rooms.|
|(Optional) Add extra features|Authentication, reviews, admin, notifications, filtering, sorting, etc.|

**In short:**  
You create a database of sample hotels with location data, build a backend to serve and search these hotels, and build a frontend where users can search and book hotels “nearby” their chosen location.

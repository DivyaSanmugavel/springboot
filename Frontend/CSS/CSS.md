### **Border**

- A **border** is like a line **around the box** of an element.
    
- It is **part of the element**â€”it takes up space.
    
- You can control each side (top, bottom, left, right) separately.
    
- You can make it rounded using `border-radius`.
    

ðŸŸ¦ Think of it like a **picture frame**â€”itâ€™s part of the frame and takes space around the picture.

### **Outline**

- An **outline** is also a line around the element, but itâ€™s more like a **highlight**.
    
- It is **outside** the element and does **not take any space**.
    
- You canâ€™t control just one sideâ€”it goes around the whole thing.
    
- Itâ€™s often used when a button or input is **focused** (clicked or selected).
    
- It canâ€™t be rounded.
    

ðŸŸ¥ Think of it like a **glow or marker line** drawn around the frame, but not part of it.
